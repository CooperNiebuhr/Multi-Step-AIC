Title: Multi-Path Forward Selection with AIC and Stability Analysis
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: 
    person("First", "Last", email = "first.last@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides multi-path forward selection using AIC. 
    Unlike traditional stepwise regression, this procedure explores multiple 
    near-optimal model paths, identifies instability via resampling-based 
    selection, and filters down to models that are both AIC competitive 
    and stable across bootstrap replicates.
